日本語の心配genAI (nihonggo no shinpai jyanai) is a gramatically awful translation of "don't worry about Japanese language".

This project aims to use Generative AI to create a conversational tutor for learning Japanese.
It aims to address short-comings of existing language learning platforms 
and emulate the experience of having a human language tutor.
